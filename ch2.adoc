This chapter introduces kubernetes, what it is, basic terminologies and the key
concepts. You will learn most of the frequently referred components in
kubernetes architecture. This chapter also provides some examples in kubernetes
cluster environment to demonstrate the basic ideas about basic kubernetes
objects.

//better to move to later chapter, still no easy way to install ...
This chapter also provides an example to launch a "minimal", but relatively
complete kubernetes environment to demonstrate how to interact with kubernetes
in practice and how the virtual environment orchestrated by kubernetes looks
like.

== What is kubernetes

starting with offical description (https://kubernetes.io/) :
____
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up
an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes
builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google,
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
____

this tells a few important facts about kubernetes:

* an open-source project initiated by google
* a mature and stable product
* an orchestration tool
* a platform dealing with containers in a higher level

////
> Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing
> containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative
> configuration and automation. 

> Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a
> decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production
> workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the
> community.
////

kubernetes was created by a group of engineers in google in 2014, with a design
and development model influenced by Google's internal system named "Borg" .
Kubernetes defines a set of "building objects" which collectively provides
mechanisms that orchestrates containerized applications across a distributed
cluster of nodes, based on system resources (CPU, memory or other custom metrics).
Kubernetes hides the complexity of managing a group of containers by providing
REST APIs for the required functionalities. 

In simple words, container technologies like docker provides you the capability
of packaging and distributing containerized applications, while an
orchestration system like kubernetes allows you to deploy and manage the
dockers in a relatively higher level and a much easier way.

[NOTE]
====
* "Borg" is still being used in google internally today
* in many document kubernetes is frequently abbreviated as "k8s" (K - eight
  characters - S), 
* the "current" (as of the writing of this book) major release is v1.14.
====

In chapter one you've learned docker has been a prevailing and pretty mature
container technology. So naturely you may wonder why you need kubernetes.

Technically speaking, kubernetes works in a relatively higher level than
dockers. what does that mean exactly? when you compare kubernetes with docker,
One analogy is to compare python with C language. C is powerful enough to
build almost everything including the whole bunch of fundamental OS components
and APIs. but you in practice you probably would prefer to write scripts to
automate tasks in your work using python much more than using C. with python
most often you only need to think of which existing module already provides the
magic you need, import it in your application and then quickly focus on how to
use the feature to get your things done. you rarely need to worry about the
low-level system API calls and hardware details.

//with assembly you will need to deal with register, flags, memory address, CPU
//vendor, model and all of the hardward specific low level details.

another analogy is TCP/IP Internet protocols. when you develop a file transfer
tool like `ftp`, naturely you prefer to start your work based on TCP socket
instead of raw socket. with TCP socket you are seating on top of the TCP
protocol, which provides a much more solid fundation that has all of the built-in
reliability features like error detection, flow and congestion control,
retransmission and so on. What you need to consider is how to deliver the data
from one end and receive it from the other end. with raw socket you are working
on IP protocol and even lower layer, so you have to consider and implement all
of the reliability features before you can even start to work on the file
transfer features of your tool.

////
another analogy is openstack UI (herizon) vs QEMU and virsh manager. with QEMU
you can start any virtual machine, either with native qemu command line or virsh
command.  doing that you have to deal with all of low level details, and the
command line goes a few lines long easily. with openstack UI it is much simpler.
basically you just choose an image, a "flavor", and virtual-network(s) and
leave all other detail parameters to openstack.
////


back to our topic of kubernetes, Assuming you want to run multiple containers
across multiple machines, you will have a lot of work to do if you interact
with docker directly. at least the following tasks should be in your "worry
list":

////
* start the right containers at the right time
* figure out how they can talk to each other
* consider storage configuration
* deal with failed containers or hardware
* consider to add redundancies and high availability to your docker application
////

* login different machines and Spawning containers across the network
* Scaling up or down by adding or removing containers when demand changes
* Keeping storage consistent with multiple instances of an application
* Distributing load between the containers running in different node
* Launching new containers on different machines if something fails

you will quickly find that doing all of this manually with docker will be
overwhelming. with the high-level abstractions and the objects representing
them in kubernetes API, all of these tasks become much easiler. 

NOTE: kubernetes is not the only tool in its kind, docker has its owen
orchestration tool named "swarm". this book will focus on kubernetes.

== Kubernetes Architecture and Components

in a Kubernetes cluster there are two type of nodes, each running a very
well-defined set of processes:

* head node: called "master", or "master node", the head and brian that does
  all thinking and decisions, all of intelligence are located here.
* worker node: called "node", or "minion", the arms and feet
  that conduct the workforce.

The "nodes" are controlled by the "master" and in most of the time you will
only need to talk to master . 

One of the most common interface between you and the cluster is a command-line
tool `kubectl`. It is installed as a client application either in the same
"master" node or in a seperate machine like in your PC. Regardless of where it
is, it can talk to the master via the REST-API exposed by the master.

later you will read example of using kubectl to create
kubernetes objects. For now just remember: Whenever you are working with
"kubectl" command, you're communicating with the cluster's "master".

NOTE: the term "node" may sound semantically ambiguous - it could mean two
things in the context of this book. Usually a "node" refers to a logical unit
in a cluster - something we call a "server", which can be either physical
server or virtual machine. in context of kubernetes clusters, a "node" often
specifically refers to a "worker node".

NOTE: you rarely need to "bypass" the master and work with nodes directly.
but you can login to node and run all docker command to check running status of
containers. there is an example showing this later in this chapter.

=== Kubernetes Master

A kubernetes "master", or "master node", is like one's head and brian. in the
cluster master provides the "control plane" that makes all of the global
decisions about the cluster. 

for example, when you need the cluster to spawn a container, the master will
decide which node to dispatch the task and spawn a container. this procedure is
called "scheduling". 

master is also responsible for maintaining the desired state for the cluster.
when you give an order "for this web server make sure there are always 2
containers backing up each other!", the master will keep monitor the running
status and spawning new container anytime when the number of the web
server containers in "running" status becomes less than 2 due to any failures. 

The master is also responsible for other many jobs. 

Typically you only need a single master node in the cluster, however, the
master can also be replicated for higher availability (HA) and redundancy.

the master's functions is implemented by a collection of processes running in
node.  The processes in a master node providing the primary features are:
////
and detecting and responding to cluster
events ().
////

* *kube-apiserver*: front-end of the control plane, providing REST APIs
* *kube-scheduler*: do the "scheduling": decide where to place the containers
  depending on system requirement (CPU, memory, harddisk, etc) and other custom
  parameters or constraints (e.g. affinity specification)
* *kube-controller-manager*: the single process implementing most of the
  different type of "controllers", which makes sure that the state of the
  system is what it should be. some controller examples:

  - Replication Controller
  - ReplicaSet
  - Deployment
  - Service Controller

* *etcd*: database to store the state of the system.

NOTE: for the sake of simplicity a few other components are not listed (e.g.
*cloud-controller-manager*, *DNS server*, *kubelet*). they are not trival
negligible components, but skipping them for now does not stop you from
understanding the kubernetes basics.

////
* And sometimes, to be able to manage all of this you have a
  process called a Kubelet. 
* And, of course, you have a container engine, you have Docker. You could have
* something else, but most of the time you have
* Docker. That's what you find on the head node, the brain of Kubernetes.
* Nothing else than four types of processes, an API server, a scheduler, a
* controller manager, and etcd. 
////

=== Kubernetes Node

nodes in a cluster are the machines that run the user end applications. in
production there can be dozens or hundreds of nodes in one cluster depending on
the designed scales. nodes are the real workforce under the hood provided by a
cluter. usually all of the containers and workloads are running in nodes. 
A "node" runs following processes:

* *Kubelet*: the Kubernetes agent process that runs on master and all the nodes.
  it interacts with master (through kube-apiserver process) and manage the
  containers in local host.
* *kube-proxy*: process that implements "kubernetes service" (will introduce
  in chapter three) using linux iptable in the node
* *container-runtime*: local container - mostly 'docker' in today's market,
  holding all of the running "dockerized" applications.

NOTE: the name "proxy" may sound confusing for kubernetes beginners. it's not
really a "proxy" in current kubernetes architecture. kube-proxy is a system
that manipulates linux IP tables in that node so that the the traffic between
the pods and the nodes will flows correctly.

=== Kubernetes Work Flow

after you get some basic idea about the master and node and the main processes
running in each, it is time to look at how things works together in figure 2.1

//image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2038044/45911926-b5345180-bde7-11e8-82bd-152fffa2774a.png[]

image::k8s-arch.drawio.png[]
//Figure 2.1 Kubernetes Architecture

At the top behind `kubectl` is where you are. via `kubectl` commands you talk
to kubernetes "master", which manages the 2 "node" boxes on the right. it
interacts with the master process "kube-apiserver" via its REST-API exposed to
the user and other processes in the system.

Now let's say you send some kubectl commands - something like `kubectl create
x`, to spawn a new container. You can give details about how exactly you want
your container to be spawned along with the running behaviors. the container
specifications can be provided either as kubectl command line parameters, or
options and values defined in a config file. You will read an example on this 
shortly.

. The `kubectl` client will first translate your CLI command to one more REST-API
call(s) and send to "kube-apiserver". 

. After validating these REST-API calls, "kube-apiserver" understands the task
and calls "kube-scheduler" process to select one "node" from all 3 available
ones to execute the job. this is the scheduling procedure.

. Once "kube-scheduler" returns the "target node", "kube-apiserver" will dispatch
the task with all of the details describing the task. 

. "kubelet" process in the target node receives the task and talks to the
container engine, for example the "docker engine" in figure 2.1, to spawn a
container with all provided parameters.

. This job and its specification will be recorded in a centralized database
`etcd`. its job is to preserve and provide access to all data of the cluster. 

NOTE: actually a `master` can be also a fully-featured `node` and carry pods
workforce just like a node does. therefore, `kubelet` and `kubec proxy`
components existing in node also exists in master. in the figure above we didn't
include these components in master, just to give a simplified conceptual
seperation of master and node. in your setup you can use command `kubectl get
pod --all-namespaces -o wide` to list all pods with their location.  pods
spawned in master is usually running as part of the kubernetes system itself -
typically within `kube-system` namespace. kubernetes `namespace` will be
discussed in chapter 3.

Of course This is just a very simplified work flow, but you get the basic idea.
In fact with the power of kubernetes you rarely need to work with containers
directly.  you will work with some higher level objects which, hide most of the
low level operation and details and present the task in a higher level and much
simpler form. 

for example, in figure 2.1 when you give the task to spawn containers,
instead of saying:

> "create two containers and make sure to spawn new ones if either one would
> fail"

in practice you just say:

> "create a RC object ('replica controller') with replica two". 

what will happen now is that once the 2 docker containers are up and running,
kube-apiserver will interact with `kube-controller-manager` to keep monitoring
the job status, and take all necessary actions to make sure the running status is
what it was defined. for example you will observe that if any one of two docker
containers goes down, a third container will be spawned and the broken one will
be removed automatically.

the 'RC' in this example, is one of the objects that is provided by kubernetes
`kube-controller-manager` process. The kubernetes objects provide an extra
layer of abstraction that gets the same (and usually more) work done under the
hood, in a simpler and clean way. Furthermore, because you are working in a
higher level and staying away from the low level details, kubernetes sharply
reduces your overall deployment time, brain effort, and troubleshooting pains.

The small "cost" of working in a level higher than docker engine is to
understand a few extra "kubernetes objects". 

you will read more about kubernetes objects in the next section.

////
Accordingly, after getting the REST-API, kube-apiserver will communicate with
the "controller-manager" to conduct the task and dispatch to the target node. 
////

=== Kubernetes Objects 

Now you understand the role of 'master' and 'node' in a kubernetes cluster, and
in figure 2.1 you see how a basic workflow looks. now let's start to look at
more kubernetes "objects" in the kubernetes architecture.

Kubernetes's objects represent: 

* deployed containerized applications and workloads
* their associated network and disk resources
* other information about what the cluster is doing. 

the most oftenly used objects are:

* basic Kubernetes objects
    - Pod
    - Service
    - Volume
    - Namespace
* higher-level objects (Controllers): 
    - ReplicationController
    - ReplicaSet
    - Deployment
    - StatefulSet
    - DaemonSet
    - Job

NOTE: "high-level" objects are build upon the basic objects. They provide
additional functionality and convenience features. 

////
below figure showing relationships between the terms you read in this
chapter: "feature", "abstraction", "objects", "process" and "controller".

    features    +---------------------------------------+

//Figure 2.2 Kubernetes objects and features
////

in the frontend, kubernetes get all things done via a group of "object".  with
kubernetes you only needs to think of how to describe your task in the config
file of the objects, no need to worry about how it will be implemented in
container level. "under the hood", kubernetes interact with the container
engine to coordinate the scheduling and execution of containers on Kubelets.
The container engine itself is responsible for running the actual container
image (e.g. by 'docker build'). 

//Higher level concepts such as service-discovery, loadbalancing and
//network policies are handled by Kubernetes as well.

you will read more about each object and their magic power with examples in
chapter 3. later in this chapter we'll look at the the most fundamental object:
POD.

////
The following steps explore how to build a kubernetes "RC" object: replica
conroller - one of the popular kubernetes objects. more objects will be
introduced in later chapters. the simple two steps are as following:

. create a yaml file: myweb_rc.yaml
+
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: myweb
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    app: myweb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myweb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myweb
        image: kubeguide/tomcat-app:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

. create the objects based on the yaml file
+
```bash
kubectl create -f myweb_rc.yaml
replicationcontroller/myweb created
```

first you create a `yaml` file to describe the object you want kubernetes to
create for you. `yaml` is a popular format to describe data structure and it is
used by kubernetes to define all its objects.
In the file is all parameters of the objects that will be spawned by
kubernetes. 
here in this example:
* the object type is "ReplicationController" - the RC
* object name is "myweb"
* replicas - the number of pod that will be launched by the RC is 2.
* 



to list the created objects:

```bash

$ kubectl get rc
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
mysql     1         1         0         10s         #<------
myweb     2         2         2         10s


$ kubectl get pod
NAME          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
myweb-nv4h8   1/1       ContainerCreating   1          1m       #<---
myweb-vzvk4   1/1       Running             1          1m
```

```bash
root@test1:~# kubectl get pod -o wide
NAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP                NODE      NOMINATED NODE
myweb-lk8jb   1/1       Running   0          1m        192.168.231.209   test3     <none>
myweb-shtj4   1/1       Running   0          1m        192.168.215.19    test2     <none>
```
////

== Kubernetes Pod

"POD" is the first kubernetes object you will learn.
the kubernetes website describe a "pod" as:

> A pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers
> (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification
> for how to run the containers

this brings 2 facts:

* basically pod is nothing but a group of containers
* all containers in a pod shares storage and network resources.

what is the benefit of using "pod" comparing with the old way of dealing with
each individual containers? considering a simple usage case that you are
deploying a web service with docker. you will need not only the frontend
service, e.g. an apache server, but also some "supporting services" like a
database server, a logging server, a monitoring server, etc. each of these
supporting services needs to be running in its own docker. so essentially you
will find yourself always working with a group of docks whenever "a web
service" docker is needed. In production the same scenario applys to most of
the other docker service as well. eventually you will ask: is there a way to
group a bunch of docker containers in a higher-level "unit", so you only
need to worry about the low-level inter-docker interaction details once?

"pod" gives the exact higher-level abstraction you are asking for. it wraps one
or more containers into one object. If your web service becomes too popular and
a single pod instance can't carry the load, with the help of other objects (RC,
deployment) you can replicate and scale up and down the same group of
containers (now in the form of one pod object) very easily - normally in a few
seconds. this sharply increased the deployment and maintenance efficiency.

besides that, containers in the same pod will share the same network space.
Containers can easily communicate with other containers in the same pod as
though they were on the same machine while maintaining a degree of isolation
from others. you'll see more about these advantages later.

now, let's get your feet wet. we'll look at how to use a config file to launch a
"pod" in kubernetes cluster.


=== YAML file

First thing to look at is YAML. Along with many other many ways of configuring
kubernetes, YAML is the "standard" format being used in kubernetes config file.
YAML is widely used in a lot of software fields so mostly likely you are
already familiar with it. In case you are not, its not a big deal because YAML
is a pretty easy language to learn. We'll explain each line of the YAML config
of a pod and you will understand the YAML format as a "by-product" of your POD
learning process.

  - name: client                <14>
    image: contrailk8sdayone/ubuntu     <15>
----

//tested. with same image (apache) both listening same port it won't work.

YAML uses 3 basic data types:

* scalars (strings/numbers): atom data item. strings like `pod-1`, port number
  `80`.
* mappings (hashes/dictionaries): key-value pairs, can be nested. `apiVersion:
  v1` is a mapping. key `apiVersion` has a value of `v1`.
* sequences (arrays/lists): collection of ordered values, without a "key". list
  items are indicated by a `-` sign. value of key `contrains` is a list
  including 2 containers.
  
in this example you are also seeing "nested" YAML data structure:

- "mapping of a mapping": `spec` is the key of a map, where you define a pod's
  specification. in this example we only define behavior of the containers to
  be launched in the pod. the value is another map with the key being
  `containers`. 
- "mapping of a list". values of the key "containers" is a list of two items:
  frontend and redis container, each of which again, are a mapping describing
  the individual container with a few attributes like name, image and ports to
  be exposed.

[NOTE]
====
.a few important rules of YAML:

* case sensitive
* elements in same level share same left indentation, the amount of indentation
  does not matter
* tab characters are not allowed to be used as indentation

before we dive into more details of the yaml file, let's finish the pod
creation:

.create pods
----
$ kubectl create -f pod-2containers-do-one.yaml
pod/pod-1 created

$ kubectl get pod -o wide
NAME   READY  STATUS             RESTARTS  AGE  IP             NODE     NOMINATED  NODE
pod-1  0/2    ContainerCreating  0         18s  10.47.255.237  cent333  <none>

$ kubectl get pod -o wide
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE      NOMINATED NODE
pod-1   2/2     Running   0          18s   10.47.255.237   cent333   <none>
----

we created our first kubernetes "object" - a pod named `pod-1`. but where are
the containers? the above output tells the clues. it reads:

a pod `pod-1` (`NAME`), containing 2 containers(`READY /2`), has been launched
in kubernetes worker node `cent333` with an IP address `10.47.255.237` assigned.
both containers in the pod is up (`READY 2/`) and has been in running `STATUS`
for 27s without any `RESTARTS`.

here is a brief line-by-line comments about what the yaml config says:

* line 1: this is a comment line. with a `#` ahead we can put any comment in the
  yaml file. 
  
NOTE: throughout this book we use this first line to give filename of a yaml
file. the filename will be used in later command when creating the object from
the yaml file.

* line 2,3,4,8: the 4 yaml mappings are the main components of a pod definition.
  - apiVersion: there are different versions, for example, v2. here specifically
    it is version 1.
  - kind: remember there are different type of kubernetes object, here we
    want kubernetes to create a 'pod' object. later you will see kind being
    `ReplicationController` or `Service` in example of other objects.
  - metadata: to identify the created objects. besides the name of the object
    to be created, another important meta data is "labels". you will read more
    about it in chapter3.
  - spec: gives the specification about the pod behavior.
* line 9-15: the pod specification here is just about the 2 containers. the
  system downloads the images, launches each container with a name and expose
  the specified ports respectively.

to get more details of what is running inside of the pod:

not surprisingly, our pod `pod-1` is composed of 2 containers declared in the
YAML file, `apache` and `db` respectively, with an IP address assigned by
kubernetes cluster and shared between all containers as shown in following
figure:

=== Pause Container

if you login to node `cent333`, you will see the docker containers running inside
of the pod:

.`pause` pod

----

the third container with image name `k8s.gcr.io/pause` is a special container
that was created by the kubernetes system for each pod.
The `pause` container is created to manage the network resources for the pod
which would be shared by all the containers of that pod.

below figure shows a pod including a few user containers and a `pause` container.

=== Intra Pod Communication

in kubernetes master, to login to a container:

.login to a container directly from master
----
#login to pod-1's container client 
$ kubectl exec -it pod-1 -c client bash
root@pod-1:/#

#login to pod-1's container server 
$ kubectl exec -it pod-1 -c server bash
root@pod-1:/app-dayone#
----

NOTE: if you ever played with docker you will immediately realized that this is
pretty neat. remember the containers were launched at one of the "node", with
docker you will have to first login to the correct remote node, and then use a
similiar `docker exec` command to login to each container. kubernetes hides
these details and allow you to do everything from one node - the master.

now check processes running in the container:

.server container

the `ps` command output shows that each container is running its own process.
however, the `ss` and `ip` command output indicate that both container share the
same exact network environment so both see the port exposed by each other.
Therefore, communication between containers in a pod can happen simply by using
`localhost`. we can test this out by starting a tcp connection using `curl`
command.

suppose from `client` container, we want to get a web page from the `server`
container. we can simply start `curl` using `localhost` IP address:

////

== Kubectl Tool 

so far you've seen we created the object by `kubectl` command. this command,
just like the `docker` command in docker world, is the interface in kubernetes
world to talk to the cluster, or more precisely, the kubernetes master, via
kubernetes API. it is a very versatile tool that provides many options to
fulfill all kinds of tasks you would need to deal with kubernetes. 

as a quick example, assuming you have enabled the auto-completion feature for
kubectl, you can list all your current environment supported options by logging
into the master and typing `kubectl`, followed by two `tab` keystrokes.

.kubectl tab completion

root@test1:~# kubectl<TAB><TAB>
alpha          attach         completion     create         exec
logs           proxy          set            wait annotate  auth
config         delete         explain        options        replace
taint          api-resources  autoscale      convert        describe       
patch          rollout        top            api-versions   certificate    
drain          get            plugin         run            uncordon apply
cluster-info   cp             edit           label          port-forward
scale          version        expose         cordon

NOTE: to setup auto-completion for kubectl command, follow the instruction from
help of `completion` option: `kubectl completion -h`

//don't panic! the most commonly used options - the ones you can reply on to get
//80% of your work done, are just a few of them.

you will see and learn some of these options in the rest part of this book.
